# Calibration-Metric-HTE
- This is the implementation code for paper entitled "Calibration Error for Heterogeneous Treatment Effect" Yizhe Xu, Steve Yadlowsky; Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS) 2022, Valencia, Spain. PMLR: Volume 151.
- Aim: We define an analogue of the L2 expected calibration error for HTEs, and propose a robust estimator. Our approach is motivated by doubly robust treatment effect estimators, making it unbiased, and resilient to confounding, overfitting, and high-dimensionality issues. Furthermore, our method is straightforward to adapt to many structures under which treatment effects can be identified, including randomized trials, observational studies, and survival analysis.
